Session:
  Title: Everything they don't tell you about context
  Description: >
    Rule number 1 of context-club, is don't talk about context. It's undocumented 
    and subject to change, but lots of libraries need it and use it. This talk 
    promises to be a humourous look at context, and will go through the concepts 
    and APIs, whilst attempting not to mention the word "context".  Some things are 
    due to change in 0.14, and there's plenty of discussion going on about how to 
    move forward with it, so let's get prepared.
