  Title: Relay-like REST-friendly Immutable-based data library
  Description: >
    In the first wave of Flux frameworks we built our own (it seems everyone had).
    However, we don't like the amount of boilerplate code we have to write, and we haven't
    found any Flux library that would solve that.

    There's a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's called Relay. Two problems.
    Relay is not here yet. And it's not designed to work with REST. Our entire platform is built
    as a collection of REST services, and we have JS SDKs that wrap around the endpoints.

    So the question is, can we have *something* that is as simple to integrate with React components
    as Relay is, and lets client-side models deal with data persistence?

    We have a POC and a plan. At this point I'm not sure if the plan will work out, which makes this
    talk proposal really interesting - either it's going to be about a brand new library,
    or it will be a reflection on what went wrong / why it can't be done.
    (But hey, we're engineers, it *has* to work. Trust me.[0])

    Petr works as a full-stack engineer/architect at Chute, a YC W12 company in San Francisco.
    He spent years trying to fell in love with Angular and Backbone.
    Then he finally discovered React, and the only thing he regrets is he did not start using it earlier.
    When he gets fed up with frontend he enjoys writing poems in Ruby, AI agents in Python, or scaling Elasticsearch.
