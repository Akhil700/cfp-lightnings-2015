Session:
  Title: values that change over time
  Description: >
    I work as a UI architect for myntra.com, which famously shut down its website earlier this, year to go app-only.
    I'd like to talk about how I dealt with the situation personally / professionally (I wrote some thoughts about this)[https://myntra.github.io/2015/05/17/personal-thoughts-on-the-shutdown-of-the-myntra-website/],
    how React saved my career and sanity, and what our new stack is starting to look like.
    Featuring - disto, my flux framework with full record / replay, dev tools, hot loading, etc, and cortex, myntra's in-house native 'content system', to be open sourced later this year.

  bio: >
    I work with user interfaces in Bangalore, mostly bashing together javascript till it makes sense.
    I've previously worked in Visa, Pramati, Idiom, Yahoo, until finally settling into a brown beanbag at
    the myntra.com office. In my spare time I play a blue Les Paul.
