  Title: d3 with React
  Description: >
    d3 has been the de facto standard when it comes to data visualisations for a while now and React
    has recently emerged as the go-to library for building user interfaces. d3 and React are both
    data-centric libraries, making them a natural fit; d3 takes a data-driven approach and React aims
    to solve the problem of data changing over time in the context of building large applications.
    
    In recent months, there have been various approaches documented on how to effectively use d3 and
    React together. In this talk, I will be going through what I have learned from all those approaches
    and how I go about creating reusable chart components with some examples of things I have already
    built.
    
    All reusable components that I make use of and present during my talk will be open sourced.
