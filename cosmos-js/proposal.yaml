Session:
  Title: Can components be truly encapsulated?
  Description: >
    Why does it become difficult to create and maintain components as your
    single page app ages?

    What if components were completely decoupled from other components and the
    global app state?

    How to design components that are truly encapsulated?

    This talk walks you through the development of Cosmos[0], a one year
    journey to create an elegant tool for designing encapsulated React
    components. How it started, the milestones and insights along the way, and
    what you can do with it today (live demo of Flatris[1] components inside
    ComponentPlayground).
