  Title: My awesome lightning
  Description: >
    Have you always wanted to write your own Yeoman generator but had tight deadlines with core codebase changing frequently?
    Awesome! We got you covered.

    One of the main Este.js design decisions was to eliminate pitfalls of overabstracted web frameworks that tend to provide
    the de facto solution to all your needs. By promoting modularity and learning from Jasmine vs Mocha war, we have decided 
    to create a quick yet simple React-first scaffold runner that will change the way you think about the code generation.

    During the 5 minutes lightning talk we are going to show you how we have nailed the common disadvantages of existing solutions
    providing our users with a relatively small tool that works like a charm in every. single. project. 

    At the end, we are also going to do a fully exclusive launch of the core runner by publishing it to the NPM registry.

    Stay tuned... and scaffold!
