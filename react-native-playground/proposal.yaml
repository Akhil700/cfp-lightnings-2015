  Title: Building the React Native Playground
  Description: >
    Soon after React Native's release, I started working on this tool to help share and test React Native apps: the React Native Playground (https://rnplay.org). Soon after, a team build around it and made it awesome in a matter of weeks: picking up sponsorship from Appetize.io and building an iOS app with React Native itself.  This talk is a quick overview of how it was built, highlighting the importance of early adopters and runnable examples.
