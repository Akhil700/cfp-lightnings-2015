  Title: Going native with Este.js
  Description: >
    Este.js is the most complete React/Flux dev stack. The perfect cure for developers already tired with mainstream frameworks 
    like Angular or Ember.

    It ships with lots of goodies including immutable single app state, top-down data passing and intl translations out of the box! 
    So let's use all these features to start building native apps!

    In this lightning I am going to walk you through the process of transitioning Este.js dev stack to the native world 
    outlining the most common problems and pitfalls we needed to face, including:
      - Project setup - preparing the native application ecosystem and reorganising the folder structure
      - Migration - moving the codebase to React Native, deciding what files can be just dropped in and what needs to be rewritten
      - Styles - replacing stylesheets and mixins with StyleSheet showing good-to-use patterns we can use to make it all maintainable
      - Routing - handling lack of the React Router with custom navigation on top of Navigator

  If you are already a React.js developer, this talk will give you an inspiration and quick overview how easily 
  you can ship your current app with native components!
